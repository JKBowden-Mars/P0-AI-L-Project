## Output for Example #5

Category: "Access / Permissions",

Priority: "P0",

Suggested_team: "IT / Systems Operations",

Summary: "User cannot access a folder they were expected to have access to by end of yesterday; this is now blocking work and has escalated urgency. Secondary concern: a client profile folder may be outdated.",

Recommended_action: "Verify folder access/permissions for the user and grant the appropriate access. Confirm whether the client profile folder staleness is a separate issue requiring follow-up and identify the owner for that update.",

Confidence: 0.72,

Explanation: "The request references leadership direction, a missed timeline ('yesterday'), and immediate urgency ('right now'), which indicates a high-priority access blocker. The 'outdated' client profile folder is mentioned but lacks details, so it is treated as a secondary item pending confirmation."

## System Output — Example 1

(Dashboard not updated + leadership pressure)

Category: Reporting / Data
Priority: P1
Suggested Team: Data / Analytics

Summary:
A dashboard has not updated since yesterday, and leadership is requesting an update. Ownership of the dashboard is unclear.

Recommended Action:
Identify the owner responsible for the dashboard and confirm the cause of the update delay. Provide a status update to leadership once verified.

Confidence: 0.70

Explanation:
The request references leadership attention and a recent lapse in expected updates, indicating elevated urgency. However, no explicit deadline or blocker is stated, so the issue is treated as high priority but not critical.

## System Output — Example 3

(Files misrouted + competing priorities)

Category: File Management / Ownership
Priority: P2
Suggested Team: Operations

Summary:
Files from an unknown team appear in the user’s directory. Ownership is unclear, and the user is unable to investigate due to higher-priority leadership work. Urgency is uncertain.

Recommended Action:
Determine the correct owner of the files and relocate them if necessary. Assign investigation to an appropriate team member if the user is unavailable.

Confidence: 0.64

Explanation:
The request contains conflicting signals about urgency and ownership. There is no clear deadline or escalation, suggesting moderate priority with a need for clarification rather than immediate action.

## System Output — Example 6

(Missed deadline + accountability gap)

Category: Delivery / Accountability
Priority: P1
Suggested Team: Engineering / Web

Summary:
Fixes for the app’s XML page missed their deadline by two days, and ownership of the task is unclear. Leadership is requesting information, creating escalation pressure.

Recommended Action:
Identify the responsible owner for the XML page fixes and provide a clear status update. Determine whether reassignment or escalation is required.

Confidence: 0.69

Explanation:
The message references a missed deadline and leadership pressure, but the immediate need is clarity on ownership and status rather than a confirmed production outage.

## System Output — Example 8

(Silent risk / early warning)

Category: Monitoring / Risk
Priority: P3
Suggested Team: Operations

Summary:
Expected updates from the night shift have not been posted since Monday, though no issues or complaints have been reported yet.

Recommended Action:
Verify whether the lack of updates is expected or indicative of a potential issue. Continue monitoring and confirm normal operation with the night shift team.

Confidence: 0.55

Explanation:
The sender explicitly notes uncertainty and the absence of reported impact, suggesting this is an early warning signal rather than an active incident.
