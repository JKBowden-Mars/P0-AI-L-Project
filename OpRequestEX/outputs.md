## Output for Example #5

Category: "Access / Permissions",

Priority: "P0",

Suggested_team: "IT / Systems Operations",

Summary: "User cannot access a folder they were expected to have access to by end of yesterday; this is now blocking work and has escalated urgency. Secondary concern: a client profile folder may be outdated.",

Recommended_action: "Verify folder access/permissions for the user and grant the appropriate access. Confirm whether the client profile folder staleness is a separate issue requiring follow-up and identify the owner for that update.",

Confidence: 0.72,

Explanation: "The request references leadership direction, a missed timeline ('yesterday'), and immediate urgency ('right now'), which indicates a high-priority access blocker. The 'outdated' client profile folder is mentioned but lacks details, so it is treated as a secondary item pending confirmation."
